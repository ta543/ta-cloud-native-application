# Cloud-Native Microservices Application with Kubernetes, Istio, and GitHub Actions Pipeline 🌩️📦🚀

## Overview 📖

This project is about constructing a **cloud-native microservices application** leveraging **Kubernetes** for orchestration, **Istio** for service mesh, and incorporating a robust **CI/CD pipeline** for streamlined deployment processes.

## Features ✨

- **Microservices Architecture** 🏗️: Design and implement several microservices using diverse programming languages and frameworks.
- **Containerization** 🐳: Utilize Docker to containerize each microservice, creating lightweight and portable containers.
- **Orchestration with Kubernetes** 🚢: Employ Kubernetes to manage the containerized applications, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficient resource utilization.
- **Service Mesh with Istio** 🕸️: Leverage Istio for managing service-to-service communication, traffic routing, and observability within the microservices ecosystem.
- **CI/CD Pipeline** 🔄: Establish a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline utilizing GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Monitoring and Logging** 📊: Integrate monitoring and logging tools such as Prometheus and Grafana for effective metrics collection, visualization, and alerting.
- **Security** 🔒: Apply security best practices including network policies, secrets management, and role-based access control (RBAC) within Kubernetes and Istio environments.
- **Fault Tolerance** ⚙️: Implement fault tolerance mechanisms like circuit breaking and retries to gracefully handle potential failures.
- **Scalability** ↕️: Architect the application to scale both horizontally and vertically in response to demand, utilizing Kubernetes autoscaling features.
- **Documentation and Testing** 📚: Ensure thorough documentation is available for setup, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for each microservice.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, EKS, GKE, etc.)
- Istio service mesh
- GitHub Actions

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/yourprojectname.git
    ```

2. **Set up the Kubernetes cluster**

    - If you're using Minikube:

        ```bash
        minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 8192
        ```

    - For cloud providers, follow their specific instructions.

3. **Install Istio onto the cluster**

    Follow the official Istio documentation for installation instructions.

4. **Deploy the microservices**

    Navigate to the deployment directory and run:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f .
    ```

5. **Set up the CI/CD pipeline**

    Configure your chosen CI/CD tool according to the pipeline configuration files included in the repository.

### Running the Application

- To access the application, find the external IP of your service:

    ```bash
    kubectl get services
    ```

- Open the IP address in your browser or API client to interact with the deployed microservices.
